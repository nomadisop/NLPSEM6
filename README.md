Patient Record Classification Project
Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering
Project Overview:
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on Patient Record Classification, where we apply various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to categorize news articles into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in classifying news articles.

Project Title:
Patient Record Classification using Natural Language Processing
Project Abstract:
Patient records contain critical medical information, and manually categorizing them is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates patient record classification using machine learning, categorizing medical notes into predefined diagnosis categories. Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization extract key medical terms, while feature extraction methods capture semantic structures. A supervised learning model assigns diagnosis categories based on linguistic and contextual patterns. By automating classification, this system enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces manual effort, and improves healthcare decision-making and patient management.
