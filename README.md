News Classification Project
Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering
Project Overview:
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on News Classification, where we apply various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to categorize news articles into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in classifying news articles.

Project Title:
News Classification using Natural Language Processing
Project Abstract:
The News Classification project aims to classify news articles into different categories like Sports, Politics, Technology, Entertainment, and Business. This task involves applying Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Language Models to accurately categorize news text based on its content. The project explores different algorithms, including traditional machine learning techniques, deep learning models, and state-of-the-art pre-trained language models. The goal is to evaluate the performance of each approach and select the best-performing model for news classification.

Conclusion:
This News Classification project demonstrates the potential of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Language Models for text classification tasks, particularly for categorizing news articles. The comparative analysis reveals that BERT, a transformer-based model, outperforms traditional methods and deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. By employing various algorithms, we gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, allowing us to choose the most suitable approach for news classification.
